# Skill Governance And Reporting

Read this reference for discovery, recommendation, install scope, quality
audit, usage cleanup, packaging, publication, and detailed reports.

## Discovery And Source Quality

Use the existing discovery stack:

- `find-skills` and `npx skills find <query>` for skills.sh.
- GitHub CLI for repository proof, stars, activity, license, and raw files.
- English and Chinese query variants for bilingual needs.
- Popular sources before long-tail repositories.

Quality thresholds are evidence, not absolute rules:

- Prefer 1K+ installs when skills.sh counts exist.
- Prefer 100+ GitHub stars when stars are relevant.
- Treat official or widely used publishers as stronger evidence.
- Treat unknown or zero-star sources as experimental unless niche exploration
  is intentional or no stronger candidate exists.

Verify each candidate before recommending or installing:

- Exact source repository, path, ref, and skill directory
- Candidate SKILL.md and same-name false positives
- License and update activity
- Scripts, dependencies, network behavior, credentials, and destructive steps
- Observed or unavailable install count, stars, and source reputation

## Install Scope

Choose global/user scope when the workflow is broadly reusable, trusted,
stable, and not tied to one repository.

Choose project scope when the skill contains private conventions, local
architecture, experiments, or trigger behavior that should not affect other
projects.

Before install:

- Check every active root for the same name.
- Compare existing and candidate versions.
- Prefer merging a user-maintained copy over adding a duplicate.
- Report whether a restart is required.

## Quality Audit Gate

Check:

- Valid SKILL.md frontmatter with name and trigger-oriented description
- Compact core instructions and correctly routed references
- Existing referenced scripts, references, assets, and eval files
- Surprising network, credential, destructive, or persistence behavior
- Documented dependencies and required CLIs
- No undeclared private services or unavailable tools
- No secrets, tokens, private data, or accidental personal paths
- No UI emoji, pseudo-icons, handwritten SVG paths, or mixed icon conventions
- Realistic eval prompts and verifiable expectations for objective workflows

Separate observation, judgement, and unverified claims. Example:

```text
Observed: eval prompts exist and the script self-test passes.
Judgement: static operational risk is controlled.
Unverified: real-world trigger accuracy across hosts.
```

## Usage Audit And Cleanup

Do not use `LastAccessTime` as usage evidence. Loaders, searches, backups, and
audits can modify access time.

Prefer evidence in this order:

1. Explicit user request to use the skill
2. Session or conversation logs naming the skill
3. Tool evidence that its SKILL.md was read
4. Available-skill metadata showing it was loadable
5. Repository or filesystem presence only

Classify candidates:

- **Confirmed active**: explicit use evidence
- **Likely active**: strong task mapping with partial logs
- **Installed but no observed usage**: present/loadable without use evidence
- **Duplicate candidate**: same or near-same skill in several roots
- **Managed**: system/plugin-owned; skip normal cleanup

Resolve and contain every target path. Reject the root itself. Quarantine or
back up uncertain candidates and use one shell end-to-end for Windows file
operations.

## Packaging And Publishing

- Run the quality audit first.
- Keep only SKILL.md and required scripts, references, assets, and evals.
- Remove caches, generated outputs, logs, credentials, and personal paths.
- Record provenance and version when derived from another source.
- Update Skill Hub lock, source, name, domain, platform, and README counts.
- Validate repository and installed copies separately.
- Review Git status, diff, anonymization, and intended publication scope before
  commit or push.
